## Spring MVC Application with MySQL World Database

Following on from the last project, you have been asked to create a Spring MVC application that interacts with the MySQL World Database.

### - The application should allow a user to view, add, update, and delete data from the 3 tables using a web interface backed by Thymeleaf.

### - You are free to use any CSS/JavaScript framework to develop the website, but we recommend you use Bootstrap.

### - Use Spring Security to secure the application. Users should be able to log in and out and only see data, while an admin should be able to perform CRUD operations.

### - The site should be tested using MockMVC for integration testing and WebMVCTests for unit testing.
